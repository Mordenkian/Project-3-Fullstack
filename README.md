Revamping of the Poject 2 Weather App using Next.js   
Setup instructions: run npm install (package.json should have all of the required listed libraries inside of it so that this command downloads all the correct files)   
API keys were moved to separate file for security reasons, message me so that I can send them to you for your own .env.local file.
